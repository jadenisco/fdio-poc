## Comments

- Color Scheme

  For a color scheme, I like simple black and white and colors to the content. I think the black and white makes the colors in the images and articles stand out.
  
- Layout/Dark Mode

  The site should look correct on a phone, this does mean supporting dark mode. The current site does not.

## To Do

- Move content over from fd.io
  - Fix author list
    - Pass in list of icons using parameters
  - Work on single webinar page
  - The Latest - Copy all the content and see what breaks
  - Documentation
  - Get Started
  - Use Cases
  - Get Involved
  - Change the Layout
    - Neal will review issue [Fd.io Issue 112](https://github.com/FDio/site/issues/112), then propose a new layout.
  - Fix Top Nav, need to add flex

- Work on Front Page
  - Neal thinks the front page should display 3-4 real use case.
  - We will have one from Netgate
  - Contact John D. Intel may have one
  - we should get one from Cisco
- Add social media icons instead of downloads

## Finished

- Change the theme from airspace-hugo
- Created New Icon space
- Add Webinar shortcodes
